I'd like to announce the release of Apache DataFu 1.4.0.  This is the first release since graduating from Apache Incubator.  Note that the artifacts now begin with `apache-datafu` instead of `apache-datafu-incubating`.

Changes:

* Removed MD5 hash for source release artifact.

The source release can be obtained from:

http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/datafu/apache-datafu-1.4.0/

Artifacts for DataFu are published in Apache's Maven Repository:

https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/public/org/apache/datafu/

Please visit the [Download](/docs/download.html) page for instructions on building from source or retrieving the artifacts in your build system.
