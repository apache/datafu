# Download

Apache DataFu is available for download as a source release and as compiled artifacts stored in a Maven repository. Please note that the latest version of datafu-pig and datafu-hourglass is not the same as the latest version of datafu-spark.

## Source Releases

The latest source release can be found here:

* <%= current_source_release_link(current_page.data.version) %>

Previous releases:

* <%= archived_source_release_link("1.6.1") %>

### Validation

It is important to validate the release using either the PGP signature (`.asc` file) or hashes (`.md5` or `.sha512` files).  For more information on verification of Apache releases, see [here](https://www.apache.org/info/verification.html).  The `KEYS` file can be found [here](https://www.apache.org/dist/datafu/KEYS).

Once fetched, the `KEYS` file can be imported and the `.asc` file can used to verify the release.

```
gpg --import KEYS
gpg --verify apache-datafu-sources-<%= current_page.data.version %>.tgz.asc apache-datafu-sources-<%= current_page.data.version %>.tgz
```

The `sha512sum` tool can be used to compute a SHA-512 hash that can be compared against the `.sha512` file:

```
sha512sum apache-datafu-sources-<%= current_page.data.version %>.tgz
cat apache-datafu-sources-<%= current_page.data.version %>.tgz.sha512
```

Note that the hashes are only intended to check that the file has been downloaded correctly.  They do not provide guarantees on the authenticity of the file.  The signature should instead be used for this purpose.  For more information see [here](https://www.apache.org/info/verification.html).

### Setup

Make sure you have [Gradle](http://gradle.org/gradle-download/) installed.  Extract the source and bootstrap the `gradlew` script that's used for building.  The `gradlew` script uses the specific version of Gradle that DataFu is intended to be built with.

    tar xvf apache-datafu-sources-<%= current_page.data.version %>.tgz
    cd apache-datafu-sources-<%= current_page.data.version %>
    gradle -b bootstrap.gradle

To build the JARs, run:

    ./gradlew assemble

This will produce JARs in the following directories:

* `datafu-spark/build/libs`
* `datafu-pig/build/libs`
* `datafu-hourglass/build/libs`

## Local Maven Install

DataFu artifacts can be installed to your local maven repository like so:

    ./gradlew install

Assuming your local maven repository is at `~/.m2`, you should see the DataFu artifacts under `~/.m2/repository/org/apache/datafu/`.  You should now be able to declare a dependency on DataFu artifacts as shown below.

## Maven

The latest release can be found in [Apache's Maven Repository for DataFu](https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/public/org/apache/datafu):

* [datafu-spark_2.11-<%= current_page.data.version %>](https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/public/org/apache/datafu/datafu-spark_2.11/<%= current_page.data.version %>/)
* [datafu-spark_2.12-<%= current_page.data.version %>](https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/public/org/apache/datafu/datafu-spark_2.12/<%= current_page.data.version %>/)
* [datafu-pig-1.6.1](https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/public/org/apache/datafu/datafu-pig/1.6.1/)
* [datafu-hourglass-1.6.1](https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/public/org/apache/datafu/datafu-hourglass/1.6.1/)

You can also use a dependency management system to download the DataFu artifacts and all their dependencies.  Some examples appear below.

SBT:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.apache.datafu" %%  "datafu-spark" % "<%= current_page.data.version %>" intransitive
```

Gradle:

```groovy
compile "org.apache.datafu:datafu-spark:<%= current_page.data.version %>"
```

Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.datafu</groupId>
  <artifactId>datafu-spark_2.12</artifactId>
  <version><%= current_page.data.version %></version>
</dependency>
```
